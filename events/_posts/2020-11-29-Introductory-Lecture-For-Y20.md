## Hello Y20! 
The BCS team conducted an introductory lecture for the incoming Y20 batch of IITK so that the freshers can gain some idea about what we do here and to encourage the enthusiasm shown by them during the SnT Pavillion and Orientation'20. We received a tremendous response from the freshers' batch and we had some really interesting discussions during the lecture. We are very excited ourselves to interact and work together with these bright minds.

The lecture was divided into 3 parts of approx. 30 mins each. The key speakers were -
