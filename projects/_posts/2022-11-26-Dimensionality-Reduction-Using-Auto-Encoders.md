title: Dimensionality Reduction Using Auto-Encoders
abstract: The problem with high dimensional data is that it means high computational cost to perform learning and it often leads to over-fitting when learning a model. Due to this reason, we have dimensionality reduction. Dimensionality reduction is the transformation of data from a high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional space so that the low-dimensional representation retains some meaningful properties of the original data. It helps in data compression, reduces computation time and helps remove redundant features, if any. In this project, we shall be comparing two methods of dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis (PCA) and auto encoders by applying them over a variety of datasets.

Using RAVDESS dataset which contains  around 1500 audio file inputs from 24 different actors (12 male and 12 female ) who recorded short audios in 8 different emotions, we will train a NLP- based model which will be able to detect among the 8 basic emotions as well as the gender of the speaker i.e. Male voice or Female voice.  After training we can deploy this model for predicting with live voices.<br>
