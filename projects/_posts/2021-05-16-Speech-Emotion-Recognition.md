title: Speech Emotion Recognition


abstract: Using RAVDESS dataset which contains  around 1500 audio file inputs from 24 different actors (12 male and 12 female ) who recorded short audios in 8 different emotions, we will train a NLP- based model which will be able to detect among the 8 basic emotions as well as the gender of the speaker i.e. Male voice or Female voice.  After training we can deploy this model for predicting with live voices.

Deliverables  
Mid-term:Learn the basics of Python, ML/DL, NLP,  librosa, sklearn, etc , Literature Review , analyzing the dataset and Feature extraction.  
End-term:Building and training the model on the training data, followed by testing on test data. And finally, testing the model on live audio input (unseen) and collecting the results.
