title: Passphrase Hackers
abstract: With recent developments in deep learning, the ubiquity of microphones and the rise in online services via personal devices, acoustic side channel attacks(ASCA) present a greater threat to keyboards than ever. We presents the implementation of a practical implementation of a state-of-the-art deep learning model in order to classify laptop keystrokes, using a smartphone integrated microphone.
